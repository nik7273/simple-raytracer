# simple-raytracer
-------------
Never had the option to take a graphics class in college, so I decided to follow the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley et al. Really cool!

Even though this code is almost the same as the code from the book, I made this public because I need a deliverable for my accountability spreadsheet. Credit goes to the authors of that book, of course.

## To run
`mkdir build` if no `build` directory exists.
```
cd build
cmake ..
make
./in_one_weekend > <output_file_name>.ppm
```
